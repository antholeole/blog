This is an open letter to myself: the traits that the people I admire the most display. I’m lucky to have great role models, and not learning from them would be such a waste.

--- 

First of all, pat yourself on the back. It’s a job that many people can’t do, despite the popular advice of “just learn to code”: it takes a special kind of human to find their “deep focus” state in an IDE, mentally working through dense pages of logic.


### Always Seek To Understand Before Applying Criticism — and Rarely Apply Criticism.


I know you’ve been there: “Who wrote this shit?” crosses your mind as you start to read some legacy code. A demon appears on your shoulder: “Refactor this all — it’s garbage. You can do better, and people will love you for it!” Perhaps the code does require a refactor — I encourage you to actually try to refactor it. Maybe you’ll run into constraints that show you why it was built the way it was, or maybe you’re successful and your team is happier for it. 

Either way, criticism towards the original author is not helpful, and not necessary.
Perhaps the engineer who wrote the code genuinely is a novice, and still learning: think back to when you were learning. Imagine your shaky hands as you submitted your first PR, anxiously awaiting your review comments. Chances are, no matter how bad your code was, your team was nice: they left comments, helpfully nudging you in the right direction. As you submitted more PR’s, your code got better and better, and less comments were required. Now imagine that Junior you got a comment similar to what you were thinking when you started to read the “garbage” code: “How could you write this? This is trash and it requires a major refactor.” 

It’s rude, but also unproductive. A refactor is essentially a large group of PR comments, applied all at once that restructures the code. Does a novice programmer really require a lashing to learn?

Perhaps the engineer who wrote is was under huge time constraints — the end users of the product wanted this feature yesterday, and there wasn’t enough time to think the design out very well. “I’ll just fix this later, when I ship it and have more time to really focus on how it’s built.” It’s a slippery slope, but such is business. If you write the greatest software in the world, but no one uses it because it takes you years, did you really write the greatest software in the world? Be sympathetic towards the constraints of the engineers of the past — they didn’t write sloppy code to spite you.

Or, finally, perhaps they did write sloppy code because they didn’t care. Perhaps they just wanted to fix the bug in the simplest way possible so they only have to work 3 hours that day, and then wanted to watch Netflix for the rest of the workday. Even if they’re explicit in their responsibility-shaking intents, getting angry is unproductive. Raging against the machine may be satisfying, but the code is still there, sloppy as before you threw your first in the air. Work hard to be better — people will notice, and you will be thanked for your efforts. And if you’re not thanked, here’s one from me: thank you for doing the right thing and making our lives easier.

### At the Same Time, Take Advice and Take Action.
Our Junior engineer in the last example was an ideal scenario. The engineer took the advice and became a better programmer for it; they learned when named parameters are better than unnamed (hint: most of the time!), they learned when to extract code into functions (hint: most of the time!).

No one writes perfect code — not even you. Take advice liberally. The person you spend the most time with is yourself — the person that understand the code you wrote the most is yourself. Even “nits” are often helpful, regadless of how trivial they feel. Capitalize the first letter of your comment, and then do it for the rest of the submitted PR’s. Other people are reading your code for the first time, and they want you to succeed: they aren’t trying to hinder you — they genuinely want the best code possible in the code base, because it makes everyone’s job easier when the code is better.

If the same comment has to appear more than once (at different points in time) then you’ve failed: you didn’t learn from the previous time — take control and learn so that you can be better.

Be Patient.

Nothing happens overnight; especially good engneering. The best written code is the world, applied to a complex problem, is complex due to the nature of the problem.

The problems that we are working on are not quick to solve: they have edge cases, branching logic, multiple entry points. The user will bend and break your program, and it’s their right to do so. They will use it “wrong” and it’s your job to make it impossible to use it wrong. This leads to complex code, not because it’s bad, but because there are many problems to solve.
You will not understand it in your first read through: you will not understand it in your fifth. You will not understand it just by reading, you will not be able to track all the paths and then keep them in your head. You will not be able to understand every layer, and you will not be able to pinpoint bugs in minutes.

Not yet, anyway.

Learning takes time; in fact, the best learning we do is when we sleep. It’s happened to you hundreds of times: you go to bed, frustrated that you can’t understand a problem or solve it efficently. You wake up the next morning with a eureka — that’s growth.

Be patient with yourself: don’t get frustrated you can’t instantly understand. Don’t get frustrated that you can’t solve every problem in minutes. You will get there, and it will be rewarding.

### Listen More Than you Speak.

Communication is important, but communication is a two way street. You can talk, or you can listen: you cannot do both at the same time. If someone is willing to talk, sit, and listen with open ears. You are the person that spends the most time with yourself; you can listen to yourself all day, every day. A new voice, a new opinion is often incredibly valuable.
Speaking is important as well, but thinking is an important prerequisite to speaking: the best engineers you know are incredibly articulated. They speak when is required, and they speak directly to a point. This is not because they are born with magic powers of dictation; they think often, formulate their thoughts, research them and then take action. Often, they do that whole process in the milliseconds before they speak, but they do not speak without having completed thinking.

And know the purpose of speaking: most of the time, it is to elicit feedback. It is to learn: not to make yourself sound smarter. Speak, then stop and go back to listening. Speak, and then learn.

No one thinks you are lacking if you are quiet — you do not need to fill the air. Listen, learn, think, formulate, speak, listen, learn. In that order.

### Do The Least Possible.

It feels good to add code. It feels good to add a PR that has a 3:1 add to remove ratio.
This is backwards. Code is a liability. Code requires maintenance, it requires people to read it, it requires time and effort. Instead, attempt a 1:3 add to remove ratio. Any PR that removes more code than adds is a success. often, this isn’t possible, but it is a idea worth shooting for.
s
The best engineers I’ve ever spoken to often answer questions with the following statement: “do we need that?” no one thinks they are lazy or unambitious. No one thinks that they are attempting to shake responsibility. They have seen the high cost of adding code, and they would like to keep things small, and efficient.

Adding code should be a deliberate decision, done by abstracting old logic, or adding new logic in a self-contained way, as to not add complexity to preexisting code.

Do the least possible, and you will see the most results.

Plan, then take Action — But Always do Both.

This one I hesitate to add, because there is a fine line.

Planning is for action.

Action produces results.

Blind action may produce negative results.

The first casualty in any war is always the plan.

Action is like fire, and planning is like earth: the earth has much fruit to bear, but needs action to activate it. Fire can be destructive undirected, but can leap us into the future if harnessed correctly.

A fine balance is always required; wisdom is knowing where that balance point is.

### Fail.

Think about the times in your life when you have learnt the most; when you have progressed the most. They all stem from failure. Failing means you have stepped out of your comfort zone, you have tried something new, and you have fell flat on your face. Perhaps the only thing you’ve learned is to not try whatever you failed at again: life is about picking battles. Knowing what battle to not select is wisdom on it’s own.

Expand your comfort zone with failures, over and over again. Failure is growth. But be sure to learn from the failures: much like “Take Advice and Take Action”, failing at the same point twice means you did not learn the first time. Learn from failures, and learn how to avoid them, or when they are necesary. Learn to be comfortable outside the comfort zone, learn to be comfortable making mistakes —learn to be wrong, and be okay with it.

### Be Proud.

And the most important for last: be proud with how far you’ve come. If you fall into cycles of failure, it’s easy to forget when you succeed. You are the product of your own decisions, for better or for worse. Even for that that which feels lucky, you put yourself in the position to succeed when the cards fall the right way.
Be thankful, be proud, but never complacent.
