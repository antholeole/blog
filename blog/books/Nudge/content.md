I love the idea that everything is a nudge, concious or not. The example of the school cafeteria is a great one: no matter how the cafeteria is organized, it will influence the students behaviors in some way. If the fruits are put first, accidently or intentionally, students may be more drawn to picking up a fruit (to fill the almost empty plate). They may not have gotten a fruit if the fruit section was way at the end, when they had already filled their plate with Mac and Cheese and Pizza. 

> An interesting aside here is that we actually can't tell which way we're nudging until we're nudging - a case for A/B testing. Extending the cafeteria example, it's possible that putting the fruit at the beginning with the intention of having more students grab fruit actually lower the fruit consumption, because the hungry students blast right past it over to the filling pasta section. *Everything* is a nudge, it just depends on if we're utilizing it intentionally or not.

"Libertarian paternalism" is also a though provoking concept. The core of the phrase is to let the ultimate decision lie with the user, but guide them to the "right" decision. They have every right to disobey the magic hand (you!) that is guiding them, but if they simply don't care, then they'll walk right where you want them to go. Sounds nefarious when you put it like that, but it actually is not at all: people simply cannot conciously make all the decisions they would need to every day. What to eat, what to wear, what tax agent to use, walk or drive, etc. are all decisions needing to be made - sometimes, I'd rather just let a decision get made for me than have to actively make a decision, given that the party deciding for me had my best interest in mind. 

> It's worth noting that this is a concept worth thinking about on both the magic hand and the guided side. Every day, I make many decisions; almost certainly the decisions are being influenced in many ways by many parties. Just the other day, I accidently bought unleaded gas instead of super unleaded (unleaded is around 15% more expensive), because typically, the super unleaded is on the far left, but this particular gas station put it in the middle. Did they try to "nudge" me into buying more expensive gas? Did they make the decision for me? What other parts of my life am I making decisions pre-made for me?

I'd like to take away a few things from this book: 

1. Understand that I should be aware of the factors in play when I make more important decisions.

Everyone is getting nudged every which way; it's important to see those nudges happening and be able to understand if I'm making a decision conciously and correctly. Unfortunatly, it's impossible to audit every single one of your decisions, but the ones that are more important can use some sensible reflection.

2. Understand that most people don't undo defaults

Defaults are very powerful. When designing software, I think it's important to make the path of least resistance also the one that people _ought_ to go down. Don't let an API that you only want people to use in emergencies (`!important` in CSS, anyone?) be the easist API to use. Instead, make it easy to use the desired API's. This goes for default settings too.

3. There is no such thing as neutral design

This one was hit on above, so I'm not going too deeply into it, but I do think it's rather important! Everything designed leads people down one path or another. There is no design that doesn't. If you think there is a neutral design, you're sublimitally pushing people down a route you might not want them to go. Think about designs and make descisions intelligently.

Overall, I did enjoy the book. The most interesting part for me to read was at the end, where they listed rebuttals people had to the first version of the book and then talked about them. That was great! more authors should do that. It creates something of a async dialog. While it was redundant at times, it is a large book about a tiny subset of psychology, and redundancy is the best way to drill concepts home.
