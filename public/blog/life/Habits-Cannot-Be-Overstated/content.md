Short mental ramble here, just to jot some thoughts down:

Habits are so stupidly powerful when used correctly it's like a self-help readers dream.

Purely anecdotally (if you want hard data, I recommend [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)) the most important things I've done have followed a simple habit pattern.

Something large like going to the gym is a goal that is often set, but it can be smaller. I've been a chronic key, mask, and airpod loser for years now - a lot of the days when I get back from the gym, I put them anywhere. When I need them next, there's always a mini (or not so mini) hunt for them. I created a goal to put them in the same place for 30 days in a row: every time I get home, go straight to a bowl and place those 3 objects in there. 

30 days is my sweet spot: if I can commit to 30 days of doing something _hard_, it becomes not so hard, and becomes a habit. A list of things I've been able to make a habit:

- Bed Making
- Gym Going
- Keys Placing
- Litter Cleaning
- Meditating
- To-Do list Checking

Of course these habits aren't permanent and they never stop taking effort to complete. It would be easier to just leave my keys in my pants, but it feels _wrong_. Creating a habit out of something makes it the 'default behavior', where not doing that behavior would have to be an intentional choice. 

Some things I have on my habit-creation To Do list:
- write here (oops!)
- LeetCode (still not a habit, although a couple times a week I get the urge to do a problem or two)
- reading (Very difficult with a not so set schedule due to school + Lacrosse)
