Hi there! I've been doing leetcode for almost two months now (I haven't written about all of them - only the ones I like. This is why there's no bit manipulation here!). And I think I've hit the intermediate plateau: I'm pretty good at solving most med-low hard. 

Here's the issues I'm noticing for me:

### 1. I'm looking to go into the first submission too fast. I need to slow down and think about the edge cases and all that.

My plan to tackle this one is to *force* myself to think of test cases before I even start coding: things like inputting 0, inputting multiple digits, etc. 

If I do this, then I will have a better understanding of the problem, as well as an easier time at the end, so I don't have to go through and worry about the edge cases.

### 2. Walk through before first submission

After I'm done with the impl, I just click "submit!" this leads to a lot of dumb errors on the first submission. I'd be much better off just walking through a trivial case, and catching little bugs that way.

### 3. I shy away from problems I don't "like"

I don't "like" bit manipulation: they all feel like "gotcha!" type problems, where you either know how to work with bits in your lang or you don't. I want to just go and do all the problems, regardless of how inclined I am to do them.

### 4. read the problem slower

Again, another "jump into it". I find that when I open up leetcode, read the problem, then come back an hour later, I come up with the solution easily. If I just read the problem slow and steady, then work through an example, I think the solutions would come easier.

From now until I consistantly hit all the relevant points, I'll be leaving a checklist on the bottom of my posts so I can self reflect.
