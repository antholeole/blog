Note: I make a lot of unsubstatiated claims in this post. These are all my personal findings and viewpoint of the developer landscape, and I'm almost certainly wrong in many aspects.

Generally in this article, what I'm refering to tutorials as are long form content, building a project from step one to the last.

I've really enjoyed my time as a content creator making tutorials for, what boils down to, "how to code." I don't have a large following nor do I post consistantly, but the gratification I do get when I post is huge, and I love helping communities that do so much for me.

Unfortunatly, as I grow as a programmer, my methodology for learning, and how I think new programmers should learn, has changed. 

There's an seemingly infinite supply of YouTube tutorials. There's clear trendlines (I haven't actually ran the numbers, but It seems obvious when you start looking) that have emerged. Beginner tutorials really take off: this makes sense. There are a ton more beginners, by definition, than any other stage of learning development: *everyone* is a beginner at one point, but not everyone hits the beginner++ stage and so on.

A trend in beginner land that the people who watch tutorials and follow them line for line stay as beginners longer than those that use the "drive in building something *you* want to build" approach. Both paths are valid, but the former (the bootcamp or youtube tutorial grad) ends up learning how to follow someone else, and code when their hand is being held, while the latter (the diver) learns how to think like a programmer, how to solve their own problems and how to be passionate about what they do.

It's not true that the diver archetype is without flaws: many divers go down the path of putting their head down and never coming up for air. This leads to a couple of issues:

- Never learning "best practices". (To peel off another layer of the union, I actually think this isn't so bad: best practices should be rooted in writing the best code. Many chronic creators will teach best practices without teaching the "why" they're considered best practices: this leads the tutorial user, when let go of their hand, to code up `FizzBuzzFactoryBuilder`.) A developer who learns in their bubble may stumble upon class based components in React, and then stop looking for alternatives, or give up before seeing the true ease of use in functional components (`useEffect` is hard to understand - `setState` is much easier. After the inital hump, though, learning functional components allows you to build quicker and with far less code). 
- The diver stays unilaterally driven: If you're following tutorials, you need to find what tutorial to look at next. You need to weigh your options, as there's far too many frameworks out there for you to watch them all. The diver may never end up exploring other frameworks.

These two problems are really non-problems, though! They're both curable ailments. Stumbling upon HN eventually in your programmer career is enough to expose you (at the surface level) to most frameworks that are still relevant.

This isn't to say tutorials don't have a place: fully exposing yourself to new dimesions of programming often requires a mentor, someone who's versed in the tech you're trying to learn. But after an inital push and some really good refrences / documentation, I think that you are actually in a great spot.

## What I'll be Working on Now

I intend to make medium length articles, like "tips and tricks" articles, and make very deep educational content. I'd like to explore the lesser known but helpful things. Perhaps I won't be getting as many views or clicks as I would be talking about Flutter or React, but I'll be enjoying my time and learning what I'd like to learn.

I'll also be working on purely entertainment content. I've always enjoyed video editing and creating content, but I never was able to motivate myself to code a project from the start to finish purely to make a tutorial. Instead, I'll be doing hobbiest stuff in my freetime, and hopefully viewers will find enjoyment in my enjoyment of tinkering.
