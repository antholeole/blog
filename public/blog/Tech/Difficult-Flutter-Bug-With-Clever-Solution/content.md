Flutter is a dangerous tool: Allow developers to build apps at the speed of light, and they're going to do just that! It can be easy to skip the basics without fully understanding them. Who cares about state when there's hundreds of widgets that do exactly what I need to - no state required?

Here's a case where a developer can fly too high, only to get their wings burnt by the sun.

---------

Here's a very simple widget:

All that this does is render an infinite scrolling rainbow list, and when you click on the floating action button, the number on each tile increments.

Amazing what you can do with less then 40 lines of code in flutter - full blown app that runs on like 10 different platforms.
