Largely, software work can be split into two groups: "complexity taming" and "complexity increasing" work. (For most B2B software, at some point complexity increasing work converts to complexity taming work - that is, a customer pays you to tame their complexity through e.g. managed services).

-  A sufficently large system requires some degree of constant maintenance burden; whether it is user-error on the customer side of monitoring issues, problems arise and time must be invested into a solution. 
-  Maintinance burden tends to grow over time given lack of complexity taming investment; the acceleration is affected by engineering effort given that enigneering effort is compelexity taming.
-  The FTE (that is, "full time engineers", or the amount of people required to do this task on a day to day basis) requirement is more or less a fixed cost; in the short term, there isn't too much that can be done about maintenance overhead without adjusting the bar for "when an issue is worth responding to". 

Because maintinance burden tends to grow, you must allocate headcount at some constant greater than the maintinance burden. We should assume that the organization running this system is profit-maximizing _in the long term_. There exists examples where an organization attempts to profit maximize in the short term - perhaps in hopes of an accquisition, or perhaps in hope that they are able to dump their shares before complexity growth becomes unmanagable.
