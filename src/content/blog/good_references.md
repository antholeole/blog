Sometimes, I stumble upon some reading material that I wish I had bookmarked for later. I've decided to start a ongoing list here so that I can always refer back to it when I need to. 

In order of finding the material:

1. [DPDK memory concepts](https://www.dpdk.org/memory-in-dpdk-part-1-general-concepts/). Good high level overview of NUMA, TLB, Huge Pages, DMA.
