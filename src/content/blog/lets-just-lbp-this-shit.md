By god, they've done it! The crazy sons of bitches actually did it: they were so neck deep in tech - debt, they just... [turned their product off](https://twitter.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1781427669801820406).

First and foremost, this is not even a scathing piece. LBP3 came out almost 16 years ago now - software that survives 16 years actually is quite incredible. God knows how many lines of code were rewritten - or even worse, never rewritten and mostly forgotten. 

Being on the "legacy maintinance" end of software is really quite interesting. On one hand, business leaders do not look at your product as "growth area" (whatever the hell that means) and so investment is little. At the same time, your product _was_ growth area at some point, and just killing a product is almost not possible.
